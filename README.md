# Hacking into Haskell

## Description

For our project, we will be looking into the Haskell framework and how it compares to Scala. We will do a short tutorial on Haskell itself with a basic program and then go over how Scala relates to Haskell, considering they are both functional programming languages. 

## Repository Organization

Our repo has the slides from our presentation, the video and then a short script.
